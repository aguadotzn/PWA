## Description

This repo is been created to learn about PWAs. I will follow [this](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/your-first-pwapp/#0) codelab. 


## Minimum requirements
1. A recent version of **Chrome**. (This works in other browsers as well, but we'll be using a few features of the Chrome DevTools to better understand what's happening at the browser level.)
2. Web Server for Chrome, or your own web server of choice
3. A text editor
4. Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Chrome DevTools
